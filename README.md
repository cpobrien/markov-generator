Markov Generator
================

Why am I doing this?
--------------------

It's both so that I can learn Go and so that I can learn more about Markov chains, which I've always been interested about. It's pretty sloppy and empty at the moment, but hopefully this will eventually turn in to a legitimate project.


Future Plans
------------

I'm considering seperating the code here into reusable, modular libraries, but it is too early to looking into making unique Github projects for all of them.
